Projects Worked on
ClickEat
The ClickEat food app makes it simple and effortless for anybody to use a mobile device to look over the menu of the best restaurants and hotels, that offer delicious and scrumptious meals around Arua City and place an order for home, office and chilling spot delivery. In this project, I used the MVVM model to develop the mobile application using the Kotlin programming language and also the restful API using the Python Flask framework. I also incorporated push notifications in the mobile app using Firebase cloud messaging service. The project was to help people around Arua city, a city in Uganda to easily order meals at affordable prices from the restaurants and hotels of their choice at their convenience also increased the customer segment for the local hotels and restaurants.
